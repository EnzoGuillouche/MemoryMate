# MemoryMate - Functional specifications

This project has been started as my moonshot project for ALGOSUP.

The goal of the project is to create an Artificial Intelligence linked with a database that supports individuals with Alzheimer's in their daily lives. The AI could understand voice orders.

## Project scope

We have multiple objectives for this project:

- Creation of an AI system and a [database](#glossary).
- Link between both the AI and the database.
- Implementation of a [NLP](#glossary) to process voices.
- Security of the database and personal information.

## Functional requirements

<!-- TO-DO -->

## Deliverables and milestones

- [Functional Specifications](../Functional/functionalSpecifications.md)
- [Technical Specifications](../Technical/technicalSpecifications.md)
- [The Architecture Diagram](../Technical/Img/architectureDiagram.png)
- [The Test Plan](../Test/testPlan.md)

| <img alt="Josh Picture" src="./Img/joshKepper.png" style="max-width: 200px;"> | **Description:**<br>Josh is a caring son facing the challenges of caring for his father, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Despite his demanding job, Josh prioritizes his family above all else.<br><br>**Frequence of use:** <br>- Often |

##### Goals

- Josh aims to provide the best possible care for his father while allowing him to maintain a sense of independence and dignity at home.
- Josh wants a tool that can assist in monitoring his father's well-being and ensuring his safety, even if he's not physically present.
- He desires a solution that can adapt to his father's preferences, habits, and changing needs over time.

##### Challenges

- Josh may face a learning curve in setting up and utilizing the AI system, especially if it involves complex configurations or interfaces.
- Josh will need to trust that the AI can provide the right support at the right time.
- He will need a solution that seamlessly fits into his father's daily life without causing disruption.

## Glossary

**Database** \
A database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a DataBase Management System (DBMS). Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** \
NLP is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language. It involves processing natural language datasets, such as text corpora or speech corpora, using either rule-based or probabilistic machine learning approaches.
