# MemoryMate - Functional specifications

This project has been started as my moonshot project for ALGOSUP.

The goal of the project is to create an Artificial Intelligence linked with a database that supports individuals with Alzheimer's in their daily lives. The AI could understand voice orders.

## Project scope

We have multiple objectives for this project:

- Creation of an AI system and a [database](#glossary).
- Link between both the AI and the database.
- Implementation of a [NLP](#glossary) to process voices.
- Security of the database and personal information.

## Glossary

**Database** \
A database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a DataBase Management System (DBMS). Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** \
NLP is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language. It involves processing natural language datasets, such as text corpora or speech corpora, using either rule-based or probabilistic machine learning approaches.
